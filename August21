#This is week one of August 2021 and the team is preparing for the first bioeng club and even planning the first holistic event.

#Second week of August was concluded by organizing an event called hands up. 
#Although it was our first event, it was full of mistakes as well as lots of things which would be remembered months to come! Everyone worked hard, I am slightly proud of us.

#This is the last week of August and we played Marvel in Science. Everyone loved it and everyone was in their geeky suit and put together their heads to solve the questions.
